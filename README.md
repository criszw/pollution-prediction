# pollution-prediction
Run a machine learning algorithm known as stack generalization. The base model included the performance of various models using only the training data set. These were then used as predictors for the upper-level model, Bayesian regularization. By stacking we were able to reduce the RMSE by 55%, achieving high accuracy when predicting pollution levels in rivers.
